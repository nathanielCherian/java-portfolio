# java-portfolio

## Usage
The whole portfolio can be launched by running main method within Main.java

## Aimboost
The aimboost game features random circles that spawn randomly and must be clicked with speed to be popped before they disappear.

## Calculator 
Standard Calculator with extra functions

## Run Game
A game that features action listeners and advanced game timers to allow a user to move around the map with WSAD and shoot with SPACE. There are enemies that chase and try to attack you.

## 3D World
The basics of a 3D game engine built in vanilla java making use of abstract classes and interfaces. When you spawn into the world you will see a grid and a cube floating above it. You can move around with WSAD and can move up with SPACE and down with SHIFT.
You can also use the arrow keys to change your field of view (looking left/right/up/down) although this feature is a little bugged as if right now. The project as a whole relies on alot of math to project the 3D points into a 2D plane.
